Fruki: A Markov Chain graphical representation generator from
Stochastic Automata Networks.

Fruki reads a SAN description file and then outputs an image
of the corresponding Markov Chain. The graphical generation
uses the graphviz (http:/www.graphviz.org) software package,
download it.

This is beta code (C# for MSVC2010), need documentation and
more testing.

For SAN language syntax, see it's grammar SAN.g and the samples.
